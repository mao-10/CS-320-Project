To ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure I would incorporate thorough testing and security checks. It's important to make sure my code aligns with software requirements and specifications. Functiontional testing would help me ensure my code/programs are in alignment with requirements and security testing would ensure it aligns with security-related requirements. Other testing methods like unit testing would ensure my code is functional and behaves as expected. User needs should be well documented and then interpreted with user stories or other methods. Tests could then be made to test user stories and make sure they are functional. To design software, I gather requirements and specifications first. Those requirements are written as user stories that I would design my software off on, with different priorities and timelines.
